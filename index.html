<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Voxer</h3>

<p>May 2012 - present<br>
Senior Software Engineer</p>

<p>Server infrastructure engineer working on one of the largest node.js deployments on a variety of tasks. Wrote a simple web application framework in support of a customer-facing administrative portal. Currently working on a clustering project to enable the Voxer service to run in many independent clusters. Skills exercised daily: Node.js, node.js at scale, riak, redis, nosql, debugging distributed processes, understanding large and tangled existing codebases. Some work open-sourced: <a href="https://github.com/ceejbot/recurring">recurring</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/ceejbot/keep-alive-agent">keep-alive-agent</a>.</p>

<h3>Sabbatical</h3>

<p>April 2009 - May 2012<br>
Chief Layabout</p>

<p>Hobby projects include a large-scale journaling community system to replace LiveJournal with a modern close-to-single-page web application. Some components of the latter project are published as open-source on my Github account. Ruby with Sinatra, node.js, redis, couchdb, browser-side work through backbone.js and my own backbone.js replacement (written when I became frustrated with typical backbone boilerplate).</p>

<h3>Danger Research, Inc, acquired by Microsoft</h3>

<p>May 2000 - April 2009<br>
Senior Software Engineer</p>

<p>Worked on both the server &amp; client sides of the Hiptop handheld platform, a cellphone &amp; GPRS data device &amp; one of the earliest smartphones. Departed in 2009 when Microsoft canceled work on Hiptop.</p>

<p>2002-2009: Device applications in Java. Did user interface design and implementation. Developed under CPU &amp; memory constraints. Rewrote the address book application to increase performance while reducing memory footprint. Architected &amp; implemented an MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service). Implemented an MP3 and video player app with features like on-the-fly playlist management, m3u playlist import, and smooth integration with the cellphone.</p>

<p>2001: As sole engineer, designed &amp; implemented the Hiplog mobile blogging system in 2 months, in Python with Medusa. The site ran without incident or intervention for 3 years before being superseded by a PHP site written by external contractors. Featured a flexible configuration that could split off services onto separate hosts to handle increasing load. </p>

<p>2000-2001: Implemented the first version of Danger's web applications in Tcl under AOLServer. As technical lead of a small team, reimplemented the apps as a PHP front-end communicating via XML-RPC to a Perl database proxy. Wrote the email, calendar, and address book applications, as well as a framework for the other applications and an early-era simple ORM. Also implemented pieces of the proxy layer that mediates communications among the database, the web applications, and the Danger device. This was an early-era web application with minimal Javascript interaction; the hot technology of the time was CSS layout.</p>

<h3>WebTV, acquired by Microsoft</h3>

<p>Sept 1997 - May 2000<br>
Software engineer. Service-side application development in C. Designed &amp; implemented management applications for the WebTV client. Email, instant messaging, WebTV device settings. Also wrote on-line help.</p>

The technical writing job required me to read operating system &amp; framework source, understand it, and document the aspects of it of interest to third-party developers.</p>

<h3>Silicon Graphics</h3>
