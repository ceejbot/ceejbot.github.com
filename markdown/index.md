## History

### Voxer
May 2012 - present  
Senior Software Engineer

Server infrastructure engineer working on one of the largest node.js deployments on a variety of tasks. Wrote a simple web application framework in support of a customer-facing administrative portal. Currently working on a clustering project to enable the Voxer service to run in many independent clusters. Skills exercised daily: Node.js, node.js at scale, riak, redis, nosql, debugging distributed processes, understanding large and tangled existing codebases. Some work open-sourced: [recurring](https://github.com/ceejbot/recurring) & [keep-alive-agent](https://github.com/ceejbot/keep-alive-agent).

### Sabbatical
April 2009 - present  
Chief Layabout

Hobby projects include a large-scale journaling community system to replace LiveJournal with a modern close-to-single-page web application. Some components of the latter project are published as open-source on my Github account. Ruby with Sinatra, node.js, redis, couchdb, browser-side work through backbone.js and my own backbone.js replacement (written when I became frustrated with typical backbone boilerplate).

### Danger Research, Inc, later Microsoft
May 2000 - April 2009  
Senior Software Engineer

Worked on both the server & client sides of the Hiptop handheld platform, a cellphone & GPRS data device & one of the earliest smartphones. Departed in 2009 when Microsoft canceled work on Hiptop.

2002-2009: Device applications in Java. Did user interface design and implementation. Developed under CPU & memory constraints. Rewrote the address book application to increase performance while reducing memory footprint. Architected & implemented an MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service). Implemented an MP3 and video player app with features like on-the-fly playlist management, m3u playlist import, and smooth integration with the cellphone.

2001: As sole engineer, designed & implemented the Hiplog mobile blogging system in 2 months, in Python with Medusa. The site ran without incident or intervention for 3 years before being superseded by a PHP site written by external contractors. Featured a flexible configuration that could split off services onto separate hosts to handle increasing load. 

2000-2001: Implemented the first version of Danger's web applications in Tcl under AOLServer. As technical lead of a small team, reimplemented the apps as a PHP front-end communicating via XML-RPC to a Perl database proxy. Wrote the email, calendar, and address book applications, as well as a framework for the other applications and an early-era simple ORM. Also implemented pieces of the proxy layer that mediates communications among the database, the web applications, and the Danger device. This was an early-era web application with minimal Javascript interaction; the hot technology of the time was CSS layout.

### WebTV/Microsoft

Software engineer. Service-side application development in C. Designed & implemented management applications for the WebTV client. Email, instant messaging, WebTV device settings. Also wrote on-line help.

### General Magic
Sept 1993 - June 1997  
Software engineer, Magic Cap development team, developing in an Objective-C-like object-oriented language. Technical writer on the _Magic Cap Class & Method Reference_, intended for application developers. The technical writing job required me to read operating system & framework source, understand it, and document the aspects of it of interest to third-party developers.

### Silicon Graphics

Technical writer, mostly writing about developer tools and compilers.
